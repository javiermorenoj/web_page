Welcome to my home page! I am a Economist (Pre-Doc) at the Financial Research Unit from the Central Bank of Chile. My research focuses on the development, computation, and estimation of DSGE models with financial frictions to analyze macroprudential policies. Additionally, I use these models to study the long-term economic implications of climate change and, more recently, its short-term effects on financial stability.
